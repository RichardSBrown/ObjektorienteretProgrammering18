# ObjektorienteretProgrammering18
A school project for jan. 2018
A project made by Richard Brown Thomsen


For The user:
- I made a simple console game, that we all know and love "Hang man". If you dont know the rules, the game can tell you them in the
main menu if you type "rules". The game is pretty self explaning for the user.


For the programmer:
- The program is made in C#, Visual studio and uses not extra addons.
- The program uses Threads(Remeber to check if the useing system.threading is there, if you wanna change something)

- If you wanna change any of the word in the pool, go to "Game" and scroll to the buttom and you'll see a array called "WordPool"
in there you can just change them as you please.
- Wanna change the number of life the user have go to "GlobalVariables" and change the "MaxLife" (default 8).
- The rules, credits and welcome can be found and changed in "Main Menu", there are 3 strings that you can change all you want.
